It primarily uses C++ for examples, but the concepts are universal and highly relevant to game development regardless of language.

**Tips for Reading:**

* **Don't just read, code!** The best way to learn algorithms is to implement them yourself. Try to code the examples and exercises in JavaScript as you go.
* **Start with "Grokking Algorithms":** Given your recent discussions and expressed interest, "Grokking Algorithms" would likely be the most engaging and immediately beneficial starting point for understanding core algorithms.
* **Mix and Match:** Feel free to jump between books or online resources based on what sparks your interest and what you need to learn for your projects.

I hope these recommendations help you on your journey into the fascinating world of algorithms and deeper JavaScript programming!
