[G] Yes, you are absolutely correct this time!

You've hit on the core design of this Minimax implementation:

1.  You need a way to represent and **read the current board state**. This is handled by the `board` 2D array that gets passed into functions like `findBestMove`, `minimax`, `evaluate`, and `isMovesLeft`. Before you call `findBestMove`, your game's main logic would update this `board` array based on the human player's move.

2.  The `findBestMove()` function is indeed designed **specifically for the AI's turn**. Its sole purpose is to determine the optimal move for the AI (`player`, which is 'x' in this code) to make *from the current board state*.

So, the flow in your game application would typically be:

* **Game Starts**
* **Human's Turn:**
    * Human makes a move on the physical/graphical board.
    * Your game logic updates the `board` array representation.
* **AI's Turn:**
    * Your game logic calls `let aiMove = findBestMove(currentBoardState);`.
    * The `findBestMove` function then performs its complex Minimax calculation.
    * `findBestMove` returns the `aiMove` (row and column).
    * Your game logic applies this `aiMove` to the physical/graphical board and updates the `board` array.
* **Repeat** until the game is over.

This design clearly separates the AI's decision-making (handled by `findBestMove` and `minimax`) from the overall game flow and input/output.

You are absolutely correct in that observation!

The provided code snippet from GeeksforGeeks is specifically written from the perspective of finding the optimal move for the `player` defined globally as `'x'`.

Here's why it appears that way:

1.  **Global `player` and `opponent`:**
    ```javascript
    let player = 'x', opponent = 'o';
    ```
    These variables are set globally and statically. The entire logic revolves around `player` being the AI and `opponent` being the human.

2.  **`evaluate()` function's perspective:**
    ```javascript
    if (b[row][0] == player)
        return +10;
    else if (b[row][0] == opponent)
        return -10;
    ```
    The `evaluate` function directly assigns `+10` if the `player` ('x') wins and `-10` if the `opponent` ('o') wins. This means the scores are always from the `player`'s ('x's) perspective.

3.  **`findBestMove()`'s initial call:**
    ```javascript
    let moveVal = minimax(board, 0, false); // << Important part
    ```
    When `findBestMove` calls `minimax` for each potential move, it passes `false` for `isMax`. This implies that after the AI (`player` / 'x') makes its move, the `opponent` ('o') is the next one to play, and the `opponent` is the Minimizer. This confirms that `findBestMove` is trying to find the best move for the `player` ('x').

**What this means for your app:**

* **If your AI always plays as 'x'**: This code will work perfectly fine for your AI's turn. You'd just call `findBestMove(currentBoardState)` when it's 'x's turn.
* **If your AI needs to play as 'o' (or switch sides):** This specific code, as written, would need modifications. It's not generalized to find the best move for *any* current player.

**How to generalize it (Conceptual):**

To make the AI capable of playing as 'o' or to handle finding the best move for whichever player's turn it is, you would typically:

1.  **Pass `currentPlayer` to `findBestMove` and `minimax`:**
    You would modify the function signatures:
    `function findBestMove(board, currentPlayer)`
    `function minimax(board, depth, currentPlayer)`

2.  **Adjust `evaluate()`:**
    The `evaluate` function would need to return scores based on the `currentPlayer` argument provided. For instance:
    ```javascript
    function evaluate(b, playerWhoWon) {
        if (playerWhoWon === 'x') return 10;
        if (playerWhoWon === 'o') return -10;
        return 0; // draw
    }
    ```
    And then, within the `minimax` function, when a terminal state is reached, you'd map:
    * If `winner === currentPlayer`: return `+10`
    * If `winner === otherPlayer`: return `-10`

3.  **Manage `isMax` based on `currentPlayer`:**
    The `isMax` flag in `minimax` usually means "is it the AI's turn?". If you want to generalize it, `isMax` would mean "is it the maximizing player's turn?".
    * When `minimax(board, depth, currentPlayer)` is called:
        * If `currentPlayer` is the one whose move you are calculating from the root (`findBestMove`'s player), then `isMax` would be true.
        * Otherwise, you'd alternate `isMax` based on whose turn it is in the recursion.

This particular GeeksforGeeks example simplifies by fixing one player ('x') as the AI, which is common for didactic purposes. However, generalizing it is definitely possible with a few modifications to make the functions aware of the `currentPlayer` whose move is being evaluated.
