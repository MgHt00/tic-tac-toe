[G] Yes, you are absolutely correct this time!

You've hit on the core design of this Minimax implementation:

1.  You need a way to represent and **read the current board state**. This is handled by the `board` 2D array that gets passed into functions like `findBestMove`, `minimax`, `evaluate`, and `isMovesLeft`. Before you call `findBestMove`, your game's main logic would update this `board` array based on the human player's move.

2.  The `findBestMove()` function is indeed designed **specifically for the AI's turn**. Its sole purpose is to determine the optimal move for the AI (`player`, which is 'x' in this code) to make *from the current board state*.

So, the flow in your game application would typically be:

* **Game Starts**
* **Human's Turn:**
    * Human makes a move on the physical/graphical board.
    * Your game logic updates the `board` array representation.
* **AI's Turn:**
    * Your game logic calls `let aiMove = findBestMove(currentBoardState);`.
    * The `findBestMove` function then performs its complex Minimax calculation.
    * `findBestMove` returns the `aiMove` (row and column).
    * Your game logic applies this `aiMove` to the physical/graphical board and updates the `board` array.
* **Repeat** until the game is over.

This design clearly separates the AI's decision-making (handled by `findBestMove` and `minimax`) from the overall game flow and input/output.
